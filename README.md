### About
The "Flutter Dartman" was created to allow users to listen to their music libraries in a new way. With animations, sound effects, and a built in "Cassette Tape" picker, users get a complete retro experience.  
    
I used Flare to create and animate the cassette tape, and the rest of the interface is composed of native Flutter widgets. Developing this app allowed me to learn about building unique user interfaces using Flutter.

## Setup and Installation

To build the Dartman app, you will first need to [install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Android Studio was the IDE used to develop this application, but Visual Studio Code should work just as well.

Once you have installed Flutter, you will need to run `flutter pub get` from the Dartman's project folder to install dependencies for the app.

Finally, connect a device or launch an emulator, then run the app using your IDE or the `flutter run` command.
